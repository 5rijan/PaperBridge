# Paperbridge

Welcome to the Paperbridge project! This repository provides the source code and resources for Paperbridge, a tool designed to enhance the accessibility and usability of scientific documents by converting PDFs to Mathpix Markdown (MMD) and allowing for editing and exporting via a browser extension.

## Overview

Paperbridge addresses the limitations of PDFs by converting them into MMD, a markup language that maintains the document's structural and semantic integrity. This process includes:

- **PDF Conversion**: Utilizing Nougat AI for accurate extraction of text, mathematical expressions, and figures.
- **Image and Metadata Extraction**: Employing PDFFigures 2.0 for precise extraction of images and their associated metadata.
- **Editing and Exporting**: Using the Paperbridge browser extension to edit and export documents in MMD and HTML formats, with features like customizable font sizes, dark mode, and integrated translation.

## Key Features

- **Nougat AI**: Advanced model for converting PDFs into MMD with superior accuracy in mathematical and tabular data extraction.
- **PDFFigures 2.0**: High-precision tool for extracting figures, tables, and metadata from scientific documents.
- **Paperbridge Extension**: User-friendly browser extension for editing MMD documents, inserting images and tables, and exporting to HTML and PDF.
